# Possessive Pronoun Usage in Bloggers with ASD

## Contents of This Repository

## Background and Goals

Preliminary, exploratory research by this author on part of speech usage in bloggers who self-disclose an ASD (autism spectrum disorder) diagnosis found that bloggers with ASD use fewer possessive pronouns (_his_, _hers_, _my_, etc.) than bloggers who do not disclose a an ASD diagnosis (and are presumed to have typical development).  

This finding is consistent with other analyses on spoken communication in ASD, and may be explained by a lack of "common ground" (mutually understood shared mental model of conversation topic) in spoken communication.  __(Lit review here!)__  To my knowledge, no analysis has been done on written communication without a specific interlocutor.  This project seeks to extend existing scholarship on linguistic differences in ASD to communications like blog posts.

In this version of my research, I intend to mine a larger number of texts by more bloggers, with more carefully chosen controls.  My research questions include:

* Do bloggers who self-disclose an ASD diagnosis use significantly fewer possessive pronouns than bloggers who do not self-disclose an ASD diagnosis?  
* If so, can this be explained by factors other than ASD diagnosis (e.g. blog topic, semantic complexity, post length, age, sentiment valence, etc.?)
* If there is indeed a difference in possessive pronoun usage which seems to be explained by ASD diagnosis, what language tools, if any, are being employed by bloggers with ASD to compensate for the lack of possessive pronouns?
 - Is there simply less reference to possession, possibly signaling different pragmatic language choices by bloggers with ASD?
 - Or are bloggers with ASD using possessive nouns (_mom's_, _David's_, _the teacher's_) to replace possessive pronouns, perhaps indicating a difference in linguistic common ground?

## Project Plan

### Human Subjects Protection

### Literature Review

### Cohort Selection

 The more difficult cohort to assemble will be bloggers with self-disclosed autism.  Once that cohort is complete, preliminary analysis on blog topics will allow me to see if matching controls by topic will be doable.

### Blog Mining

### Linguistic Analysis

### Statistical Methods

### Disclosure of Findings
