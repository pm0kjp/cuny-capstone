* Interesting quotes re: internet empowerment of autistic ppl:
 - 'As Singer (1999:67) suggests, the Internet has done "what was thought impossible—to bind autistics together into groups, and it is this which will finally enable them to claim a voice in society."' (refers to Singer, Judy 1999 “Why Can't You Be Normal for Once in Your Life?” From a “Problem with No Name” to the Emergence of a New Category of Difference. In Disability Discourse. MiriamCorker and SallyFrench, eds. Pp. 57–67. Philadelphia: Open University Press.)
 - 'As Blume (1997a:6) so eloquently noted, "In cyberspace, many of the nation's autistics are doing the very thing the syndrome supposedly deters them from doing—communicating."'.  Refers to Blume, Harvey 1997a Connections: Autistics are Communicating in Cyberspace. New York Times, June 30.

AT Newton, ADI Kramer, DN McIntosh - Proceedings of the SIGCHI …, 2009 - dl.acm.org

* Proposes that communication difficulties in ASD are ameliorated by this communication type, as communication deficits may be largely contextual

* Some ASD subj report that the distal quality of blogging relieves pressure and allows for social interaction at their pace / comfort level
* Word usage in blogs has already (date?) been normed on general population
* Criteria for inclusion:
 - Blogger appeared 18+ years of age
 - Personal, diary-type content
 - Publicly accessible
 - 1+ post per month
