Keywords: Autism spectrum disorder; agreement; grammatical morphology; language impairment; syntactic categories

Abstract:

Mixed and inconsistent findings have been reported across languages concerning grammatical morphology in speakers with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some researchers argue for a selective sparing of grammar whereas others claim to have identified grammatical deficits. The present study aimed to investigate this issue in 26 participants with ASD speaking European French who were matched on age, gender and SES to 26 participants with typical development (TD). The groups were compared regarding their productivity and accuracy of syntactic and agreement categories using the French MOR part-of-speech tagger available from the CHILDES. The groups significantly differed in productivity with respect to nouns, adjectives, determiners, prepositions and gender markers. Error analysis revealed that ASD speakers exhibited a disrupted behaviour in grammatical morphology. They made gender, tense and preposition errors and they omitted determiners and pronouns in nominal and verbal contexts. ASD speakers may have a reduced sensitivity to perceiving and processing the distributional structure of syntactic categories when producing grammatical morphemes and agreement categories. The theoretical and cross-linguistic implications of these findings are discussed.

Disposition: Possible non review, limited applicability to English speakers.  However, pronoun omission is mentioned in abstract.

Keywords: c-command; disjunction; grammatical development; negation; reflexives

Abstract:

A recent study questioned the adherence of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to a linguistic constraint on the use of reflexive pronouns (Principle A) in sentences like Bart's dad is touching himself. This led researchers to question whether children with ASD are able to compute the hierarchical structural relationship of c-command, and raised the possibility that the children rely on a linear strategy for reference assignment. The current study investigates the status of c-command in children with ASD by testing their interpretation of sentences like (1) and (2) that tease apart use of c-command and a linear strategy for reference assignment. The girl who stayed up late will not get a dime or a jewel (C-command)The girl who didn't go to sleep will get a dime or a jewel (Non C-command) These examples both contain negation (not or didn't) and disjunction (or). In (1), negation c-commands the disjunction phrase, yielding a conjunctive entailment. This gives rise to the meaning that the girl who stayed up late won't get a dime and she won't get a jewel. In (2), negation is positioned inside a relative clause and it does not c-command disjunction. Therefore, no conjunctive entailment follows. Thus, (2) is true if the girl just gets a dime or just a jewel, or possibly both. If children with ASD lack c-command, then (1) will not give rise to a conjunctive entailment. In this case, children might rely on a linear strategy for reference assignment. Since negation precedes disjunction in both (1) and (2), they might be interpreted in a similar manner. Likewise, children who show knowledge of c-command should perform well on sentences governed by Principle A. These hypotheses were tested in experiments with 12 Australian children with HFA, aged 5;4 to 12;7, and 12 typically-developing controls, matched on non-verbal IQ. There was no significant difference in the pattern of responses by children with HFA and the control children on either (1) and (2) or the Principle A sentences. The findings provide preliminary support for the proposal that knowledge of c-command and Principle A is intact in HFA children.

Disposition: Worth evaluating because of HFA subjects and study of reflexive pronouns (experiment 2) with consideration of antecedent identification.  Findings include slightly poorer performance on reflexive pronoun antecedent parsing.

'Form is easy, meaning is hard' revisited: (re) characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of language in children with autism spectrum disorder.

Abstract:

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate impairments in social interaction and communication, and in repetitive/stereotypical behaviors. The degree to which children with ASD also manifest impairments in structural language-such as lexicon and grammar-is currently quite controversial. We reframe this controversy in terms of Naigles' (Naigles, Cognition 2002, 86: 157-199) 'form is easy, meaning is hard' thesis, and propose that the social difficulties of children with ASD will lead the meaning-related components of their language to be relatively more impaired than the form-related components. Our review of the extant literature supports this proposal, with studies (1) reporting that children with ASD demonstrate significant challenges in the areas of pragmatics and lexical/semantic organization and (2) highlighting their good performance on grammatical assessments ranging from wh-questions to reflexive pronouns. Studies on children with ASD who might have a co-morbid grammatical impairment are discussed in light of the absence of relevant lexical-semantic data from the same children. Most importantly, we present direct comparisons of assessments of lexical/semantic organization and grammatical knowledge from the same children from our laboratory, all of which find more children at a given age demonstrating grammatical knowledge than semantic organization. We conclude with a call for additional research in which in-depth grammatical knowledge and detailed semantic organization are assessed in the same children.

"Didn't I just say that?" Comparing parent report and spontaneous speech as indicators of grammatical development.

Keywords: ASD; Grammatical items; Language assessment; Spontaneous speech; Vineland

Abstract: 
BACKGROUND:
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales use parental report to examine communication and social skills in children with typical and atypical development, and exhibit high reliability when compared against overall direct testing. However, findings are mixed comparing Vineland communication/language scores with experimenter-administered tests of language.

METHODS:
The current study breaks new ground in comparing Vineland reports with direct observation of children's speech by (a) individual items and (b) level of child functioning, focusing on usage of wh-questions, verb tenses, negation, pronouns and noun-verb combinations. Both 'high-verbal' (HV) and 'middle-verbal' (MV) children with ASD are included, as well as a language-matched TD group.

RESULTS:
The results revealed that parent report on the Vineland varies in accuracy of capturing the production of grammatical items by young children with ASD and TD children. While parents' assessment of their child's production of noun-verb combinations and 'who/why' was highly accurate, children's production of pronouns was under-rated by parents. Additionally, parents of HV children also under-rated their child's production of past regular verbs.

CONCLUSION:
Underestimation of these grammatical elements could lead to mistaken conclusions about their development in ASD or in individual children.

Notable quotes:
"...pronouns, wh-questions, and tense markers are frequently mentioned as key linguistic difficulties for children with ASDs (Eigsti, Bennetto & Dadlani, 2007; Park, Yelland, Taffee & Gray, 2012; Tager-Flusberg, Paul & Lord, 2005), especially those with co-morbid grammatical impairments (Norbury, 2013)."

Disposition: mentions pronouns, but may be principally a psychometric review.  Worth a look.

The Interface of Syntax with Pragmatics and Prosody in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Abstract:

In order to study problems of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) with morphosyntax, we investigated twenty high-functioning Greek-speaking children (mean age: 6;11) and twenty age- and language-matched typically developing children on environments that allow or forbid object clitics or their corresponding noun phrase. Children with ASD fell behind typically developing children in comprehending and producing simple clitics and producing noun phrases in focus structures. The two groups performed similarly in comprehending and producing clitics in clitic left dislocation and in producing noun phrases in non-focus structures. We argue that children with ASD have difficulties at the interface of (morpho)syntax with pragmatics and prosody, namely, distinguishing a discourse prominent element, and considering intonation relevant for a particular interpretation that excludes clitics.

Disposition: Important because of mention of "distinguishing a discourse prominent element."
