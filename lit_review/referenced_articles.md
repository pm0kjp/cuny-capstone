SINCLAIR, J. Why I dislike “person first” Language. Autonomy, the Critical Journal of Interdisciplinary Autism Studies, North America, 1, oct. 2013. Available at: <http://www.larry-arnold.net/Autonomy/index.php/autonomy/article/view/22>. Date accessed: 08 Feb. 2018.

Three reasons why person-first language (person with autism) is objectionable:

1) Autism is inherent and inseparable from the person:  'I am
usually a “person with a purple shirt,” but I could also be a “person with a blue shirt” one day, and a
“person with a yellow shirt” the next day, and I would still be the same person, because my clothing is not
part of me. But autism is part of me.'

2) Autism is central to one's identity.  'Characteristics that are recognized as central to a person’s identity are appropriately stated as adjectives, and may even be used as nouns...:
“male” and “female” people, and even about “men” and “women” ... not about “people with maleness”
and “people with femaleness.” ... “Russian” or “Catholic,” not as “person with Russianity” or “person with Catholicism.” ... “parent” or “worker,” not as “person with offspring” or “person who has a job.” ... “generous” or “outgoing,” not person first language as “person with generosity” or “person with extroversion.”Yet autism goes deeper than culture and learned belief systems. It affects how we relate to others and how we find places in society. ... I am autistic because autism is an essential feature of me as a person.'

3) Autism is not negative.  'Nobody objects to using adjectives to refer to characteristics of a person that are considered positive or neutral. We talk about left-handed people, not “people with left-handedness,” and
about athletic or musical people, not about “people with athleticism” or “people with musicality.” We
might call someone a “blue-eyed person” or a “person with blue eyes,” and nobody objects to either
descriptor. It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that
suddenly people want to separate it from the person...I am autistic because I accept and value myself the way I am.

Comparison of Grammar in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: The Case of Binding in Williams Syndrome and Autism With and Without Language Impairment.
Perovic A1, Modyanova N2, Wexler K2.
Abstract

This study investigates whether distinct neurodevelopmental disorders show distinct patterns of impairments in particular grammatical abilities and the relation of those grammatical patterns to general language delays and intellectual disabilities. We studied two disorders (autism and Williams syndrome [WS]) and two distinct properties (Principle A that governs reflexives and Principle B that, together with its associated pragmatic rule, governs pronouns) of the binding module of grammar. These properties are known to have markedly different courses of acquisition in typical development. We compare the knowledge of binding in children with autism with language impairment (ALI) and those with normal language (ALN) to that of children with WS, matched on age to the ALN group, and on age and nonverbal mental age (MA) to the ALI group, as well as to two groups of typically developing (TD) controls, matched on nonverbal MA to ALI and ALN groups. Our results reveal a remarkably different pattern of comprehension of personal pronouns and reflexives in ALI as opposed to ALN, WS, and two groups of TD controls. All five groups demonstrated an equal delay in their comprehension of personal pronouns, in line with widely reported delays in TD literature, argued to be due to delayed pragmatic abilities. However, and most strikingly, the ALI group also showed a pronounced difficulty in comprehension of reflexive pronouns, and particularly of the knowledge that the antecedent of a reflexive must c-command it. The revealed pattern confirms the existence of a particular impairment concerning Principle A in this module of grammar, unrelated to general language delays or cognitive deficits generally present in a large portion of individuals with autism as well as WS, or to general pragmatic deficits, known to be particularly prevalent in the population with autism.
