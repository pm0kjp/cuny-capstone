* Anaphor: "An anaphor is an item with little or no intrinsic meaning or reference that takes its interpretation from another item in the same sentence or discourse, its antecedent. For example, in ‘I asked Johnny to come with me and _he_ came’. (Here, the anaphor is italicised)." https://link-springer-com.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/article/10.1007/s10803-007-0357-5

* Anaphoric pronoun: "Anaphoric pronoun refers to a pronoun which 'refers back' to another constituent in the sentence." [Glottopedia](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Anaphoric_pronoun)

* binding: "In linguistics, binding is the distribution of anaphoric elements (pronouns and other pro-forms). A pronoun (a "bindee") usually has an antecedent (a "binder") in context. The goal of binding theory is to identify the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given pronoun or noun and its antecedent (or postcedent), e.g. *John said he would help* vs. *He said John would help* (the second sentence is not possible if he is intended to mean John)." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_(linguistics))

* Deictic pronoun: "Deictic pronoun is a pronoun whose reference must be fixed through the context of the utterance.... The purported referents of _you_ and _me_ in _you will get to know me better_ are the speaker and the addressee(s) of this utterance. Deictic pronouns are often opposed to anaphoric pronouns." [Glottopedia](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Deictic_pronoun)


* deixis: "Deixis is the phenomenon that elements in a language may have a reference which is dependent on the immediate context of their utterance. The term is introduced to handle the 'orientational' features of language which are relative to the time and place of utterance....
(i) personal pronouns: I, you, he, etc." [Glottopedia](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Deixis)

* Government and binding theory:  "Government and binding (GB, GBT) is a theory of syntax and a phrase structure grammar (as opposed to a dependency grammar) in the tradition of transformational grammar developed principally by Noam Chomsky in the 1980s." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_and_binding_theory).  "The binding theory that became established at that time is still considered a reference point, though its validity is no longer accepted." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_(linguistics))

* Principle A, B, C: Principles of binding theory.  __Principle A__ states that reflexive (*himself*, *ourselves*, etc.) and reciprocals (e.g. *each other*) must have antecedents (be bound) that make sense (right gender/number etc.) in the same sentence -- they can't stand alone.  Additionally, the antecedent has to be well-bound (can't be too close or too far apart, or it won't make sense).  An example of ill-formed syntax with bad binding would be *John thinks that I like himself*.  __Principle B__ states that other pronouns must *not* be bound.  __Principle C__ 

* theory of mind (ToM): one's recognition of the mental state or expected knowledge of another (e.g. a child understanding that a parent has not seen what happened in a room where the parent was absent). Happé and others suggest that a diminished ToM may be the source of pragmatic communication deficits in people with ASD.  This is important for us because a writer with impaired ToM may over- or under- estimate the reader's awareness of the content and use (or avoid using) pronouns based on that misestimation.  

* zero: "In linguistics, a zero or null is a segment which is not pronounced or written." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(linguistics))  Example: "George walked in and (0) sat down." The zero here is the understood "he" or "George".
