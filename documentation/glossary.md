* binding: "In linguistics, binding is the distribution of anaphoric elements (pronouns and other pro-forms). A pronoun (a "bindee") usually has an antecedent (a "binder") in context. The goal of binding theory is to identify the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given pronoun or noun and its antecedent (or postcedent), e.g. *John said he would help* vs. *He said John would help* (the second sentence is not possible if he is intended to mean John)."

* Government and binding theory:  "Government and binding (GB, GBT) is a theory of syntax and a phrase structure grammar (as opposed to a dependency grammar) in the tradition of transformational grammar developed principally by Noam Chomsky in the 1980s." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_and_binding_theory).  "The binding theory that became established at that time is still considered a reference point, though its validity is no longer accepted." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_(linguistics))

* Principle A, B, C: Principles of binding theory.  __Principle A__ states that reflexive (*himself*, *ourselves*, etc.) and reciprocals (e.g. *each other*) must have antecedents (be bound) that make sense (right gender/number etc.) in the same sentence -- they can't stand alone.  Additionally, the antecedent has to be well-bound (can't be too close or too far apart, or it won't make sense).  An example of ill-formed syntax with bad binding would be *John thinks that I like himself*.  __Principle B__ states that other pronouns must *not* be bound.  __Principle C__ 

* theory of mind (ToM): one's recognition of the mental state or expected knowledge of another (e.g. a child understanding that a parent has not seen what happened in a room where the parent was absent). Happ√© and others suggest that a diminished ToM may be the source of pragmatic communication deficits in people with ASD.  This is important for us because a writer with impaired ToM may over- or under- estimate the reader's awareness of the content and use (or avoid using) pronouns based on that misestimation.

* zero: "In linguistics, a zero or null is a segment which is not pronounced or written." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(linguistics))
