* theory of mind (ToM): one's recognition of the mental state or expected knowledge of another (e.g. a child understanding that a parent has not seen what happened in a room where the parent was absent). Happ√© and others suggest that a diminished ToM may be the source of pragmatic communication deficits in people with ASD.  This is important for us because a writer with impaired ToM may over- or under- estimate the reader's awareness of the content and use (or avoid using) pronouns based on that misestimation.

* zero: "In linguistics, a zero or null is a segment which is not pronounced or written." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(linguistics))
