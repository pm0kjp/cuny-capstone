## Rama Novogrodsky & Lisa R. Edelson (2016). "Ambiguous pronoun use in narratives of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders." _Child Language Teaching and Therapy_, 32, 241-252.

__Abstract:__ This study explored pronoun production and general syntactic abilities in story retelling and story generation among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Twenty-four children diagnosed with ASD, ages 6;1–14;3 and 17 typically-developing (TD) children ages 5;11–14;4 participated in the study. The linguistic measures for general syntax were sentence complexity and morpho-syntactic errors. The pronoun production measure was referential use of third person subject, object and possessive pronouns. The results revealed no group differences in general syntactic measures in either task. The ambiguous third person pronoun measure showed different results between the two tasks. Although there was no difference between the groups in the retelling task, children with ASD produced more ambiguous pronouns in the story-generation task than did the TD children. Interestingly, this pattern was shown for different types of pronouns, suggesting a cognitive deficit in monitoring the listener’s mental model.

Interesting quotes / ideas:

* "However, children with ASD produced significantly more ambiguous pronouns than did the TD children in the story-generation task, but not in the story-retelling task."  _While this study deals with narrative (which is a specific type of language), it is relevant to our interests of bloggers who generate their own content, rather than reconstructing the content written by another._

* "Previously published literature tested only subject pronouns." _If this is true, research on possessive pronoun use in people with ASD is relatively novel._

* "It is suggested that children with ASD err in pronoun use due to general deficits in referential facility and not due to syntactic constraints. The children with ASD produced more tokens of ambiguous subject and possessive pronouns compared with the TD group."  _If this is true for children, is it possible that high-functioning, highly motivated bloggers (who are likely to be adults) have responded to feedback that their antecedants are ambiguous and learned to use specific nouns instead of pronouns?_

* "A recent study tested comprehension of possessives and found typical performance in children with ASD (Perovic et al., 2012)."  _So, differences in possessive pronoun usage in people with ASD may not be attributable to a lack of comprehension in receptive language._

* "Subject possessives (Bart’s dad) represent relations between two NPs and are different from possessive pronouns (his dad). In addition, the task in the current study was a production task, whereas Perovic et al. (2012) evaluated a comprehension task. Further research is needed to better understand the linguistically unique features of possessives and to what degree they are preserved in the language of children with ASD." _We're on it!_
